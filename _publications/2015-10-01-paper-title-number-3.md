excerpt: 'Graph neural network approaches, which jointly learn a graph structure based on the correlation of raw values of multivariate time series while forecasting, have recently seen great success. However, such solutions are often costly to train and difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose TimeGNN, a method that learns dynamic temporal graph representations that can capture the evolution of inter-series patterns along with the correlations of multiple series.'
