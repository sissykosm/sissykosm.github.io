excerpt: 'We focus on the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) epidemic model on networks. Given that this model can be expressed by an intractable system of ordinary differential equations, we devise a simpler system that approximates the output of the model. Then, we capitalize on recent advances in neural ordinary differential equations and propose a neural architecture that can effectively predict the course of an epidemic on the network.[Read More](https://openreview.net/forum?id=yrkJGne0vN)'
