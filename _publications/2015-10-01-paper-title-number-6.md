title: "The Signed Two-Space Proximity Model for Learning Representations in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-6
excerpt: 'To accurately represent biological relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions, reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles.'
