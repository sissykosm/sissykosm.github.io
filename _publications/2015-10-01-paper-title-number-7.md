excerpt: 'We mathematically formulate and technically design efficient and hard-coded invariant convolutions for specific group actions applicable to the case of time series. We construct these convolutions by considering specific sets of deformations commonly observed in time series, including scaling, offset shift, and trend. We further combine the proposed invariant convolutions with standard convolutions in single embedding layers, and we showcase the layer capacity to capture complex invariant time series properties in several scenarios.'
