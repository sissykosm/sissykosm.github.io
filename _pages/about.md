I am a final-year PhD student in Computer Science & Machine Learning at the [Dascim Group](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/), based at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, in France. I work under the supervision of Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis, focusing on robust deep learning methods for time series data and dynamical systems. Before this, I obtained a 5-year integrated diploma (MEng equivalent) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), Greece. I am passionate about the efficient and scalable application of deep learning to solving real-world problems, involving complex and dynamically evolving data.
