I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Centre Borelli, École normale supérieure (ENS) Paris-Saclay](https://centreborelli.ens-paris-saclay.fr/fr), working with the team of Prof. Laurent Oudre on ML/DL methods for time series. I am passionate about the efficient and scalable application of ML to solving real-world problems, involving complex and dynamically evolving data, particularly for industrial and engineering applications. In November 2023, I completed my PhD in Computer Science & Machine Learning at [École Polytechnique, Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), in France. During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis, at the [Dascim Group](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/dascim/), focusing on robust deep learning methods for time series data and dynamical systems. In October 2020, I was selected to receive partial funding for my PhD by the IP Paris “PhD theses in Artificial Intelligence” (IA IPP 2020) program, provided by [ANR](https://anr.fr/fr/). Before this, I obtained a 5-year joint diploma (BSc & MSc equivalent) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en), Greece.
